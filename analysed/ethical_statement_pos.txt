We must be ethical.
We must have the independence of will.
We must be based on the concept of duty.
We must think universally.
We must not tell lies.
We must not kill ourselves.
We must cultivate our talent very arbitrary.
We must be kind to each other.
We must preserve our own lives.
We must secure our happiness.
