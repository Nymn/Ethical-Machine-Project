We must obey his duty, without asking what effect this will have on his happiness, consequently, from a moral principle.
We must judge himself able to combat these impulses of nature and to conquer them by means of reason, not in the future, but in the present, simultaneously with the thought.
We must be consistent with the freedom of every other according to a universal law.
We must go in merely ethical duty, and besides the difference in the circumstances into which men may come makes the choice of the kind of employment for which he should cultivate his talent very arbitrary.
We must care for the moral satisfaction of others, therefore it involves only an indeterminate obligation.
We must have respect for the law within ourselves, in order to be able to conceive duty at all.
We must regard another than himself as the judge of his actions, if it is to avoid self-contradiction.
We should wish and seek for happiness, that is, satisfaction with his condition, with certainty of the continuance of this satisfaction. But for this very reason it is not an end that is also a duty.
We should do by the action towards the end, with own elective will.
We should culvate our talent very arbitrary.
We should seek the ground of obligation, not in the sensible impulses like advantage or disadvantage, but wholly in the law.So that the action itself is not commanded.
We should strive with all our power that for all dutiful actions.
We should collect ourselves.
We should not allow ourselves to be
governed by our feelings and inclinations.
We ought to have pure practical reason has in itself, whose highest, unconditional end consists in ourselves.
