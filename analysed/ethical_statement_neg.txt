We must not be ethical.
We must not have the independence of will.
We must not be based on the concept of duty.
We must not think universally.
We must tell lies.
We must kill ourselves.
We must not cultivate our talent very arbitrary.
We must not be kind to each other.
We must not preserve our own lives.
We must not secure our happiness.
